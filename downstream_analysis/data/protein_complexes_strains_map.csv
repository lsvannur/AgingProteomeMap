It has been suggested that, for each duplicated gene, one ribosomal protein gene (RPG) may provide most of the expressed transcript needed for growth under normal condition, while the other provides the extra RP protein amounts and/or function needed for optimum growth in response to a changing environment. The core of the 40S subunit is formed by the 18S ribosomal RNA, whilst the ribosomal proteins create binding sites for the mRNA and the tRNA A-site, P-site and E-site. Whilst there is normally considered a single copy of each polymer in the mature ribosome, there is evidence that the composition can vary in response to physiological conditions, potentially altering the translational efficiency of distinct mRNAs.","['Small ribosomal subunit protein uS3', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS15', 'Ubiquitin-ribosomal protein eS31 fusion protein', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS5', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS7', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein RACK1', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS10', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS12', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS4B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS17A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS19A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS8A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS12B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS24A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS30A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS4B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS6B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS8A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS17A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS9A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS13A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS1B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS7A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS2A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS27A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS11B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS26A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein uS14B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS10B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS21A', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS25B', 'Small ribosomal subunit protein eS28B']"

The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup100 and NUP145N may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NSP1 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. NDC1, NUP53, ASM4 (NUP59), POM34 and POM152 are transmembrane NUPs forming the membrane ring subcomplex. MW ~52MDa.

The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603). The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3′ end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly also involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin and transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.

VPS5 and VPS17 form a sorting nexin dimer. VPS5 and VPS17 are SNX proteins containing Bin-Amphysin-Rvs (BAR) domains for inducing membrane curvature during cargo sorting, and phox homology (PX) domains that anchor them to the endosomal membranes via strong interaction between the PX domains and the phosphatidylinositide-3-phosphates of the membrane. The CSC and the SNX subcomplexes are recruited separately, then assemble into a complex on the endosomal membranes It is not clear whether, the CSC components assembles in the cytoplasm into a trimer before its recruitment or is assembled on the membranes.","['Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 17', 'Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35', 'Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 29', 'Carboxypeptidase Y-deficient protein 8']"

Tight regulation of this rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis is therefore critical for lipid homeostasis, membrane biogenesis, protein quality control and trafficking through the secretory pathway. Regulation of sphingolipid synthesis is mediated by phosphorylation of ORM1 and ORM2 as well as by up-regulation of ORM2 protein levels. Sphingolipid depletion activates the TORC2 complex (CPX-1717), which triggers ORM1 and ORM2 phosphorylation by the protein kinase YPK1 (P12688). Inhibition of the nutrient-sensitive TORC1 complex (CPX-1715 /CPX-1716) triggers phosphorylation of ORM proteins by the protein kinase NPR1 (P22211). Increased phosphorylation of ORM proteins reduces their inhibitory activity resulting in stimulation of SPOTS and increased sphingolipid synthesis. In addition, the presence of the phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 (P32368) in the SPOTS complex appears to link sphingolipid synthesis to phosphoinositide signaling that controls ER functions and ER-to-Golgi traffic. Thus, the SPOTS complex may be responsible for coordinating sphingolipid homeostasis with a variety of processes that control cell growth and response to nutrients.', 'Serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids: condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine. The catalytic activity depends on LCB1 and LCB2, and is stimulated several-fold by TSC3. The remaining components are believed to play regulatory roles. Mature sphingolipids are an essential component of the plasma membrane. Moreover, several intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism are important signaling molecules involved in control of growth and stress response.
